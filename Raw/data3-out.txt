Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so **Alice** soon began
talking again. Dinah ll miss me very much to night, I should think!
Dinah was the cat. I hope they ll remember her saucer of milk at tea
time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no
mice in the air, I m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that s very
like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder? And here
**Alice** began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in
a dreamy sort of way, Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats? and sometimes,
Do bats eat cats? for, you see, as she couldn t answer either question,
it didn t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing
off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with
Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:
did you ever eat a bat? when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon
a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.

**Alice** was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a
moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was
another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying
down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went **Alice** like the
wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, Oh my
ears and whiskers, how late it s getting! She was close behind it when
she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she
found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps
hanging from the roof.

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
**Alice** had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying
every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever
to get out again.

Suddenly she came upon a little three legged table, all made of solid
glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and **Alice** s
first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

**Alice** opened the door and found that it led into a small passage,
not much larger than a rat hole: she knelt down and looked along the
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get
out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright
flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head
through the doorway; and even if my head would go through, thought poor
**Alice**, it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how
I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know
how to begin. For, you see, so many out of the way things had happened
lately, that **Alice** had begun to think that very few things indeed
were really impossible.

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
time she found a little **bottle** on it, which certainly was not here
before, said **Alice**, and round the neck of the **bottle** was a paper
label, with the words **DRINK** ME beautifully printed on it in large
letters.

It was all very well to say **Drink** me, but the wise little **Alice**
was not going to do THAT in a hurry. No, I ll look first, she said, and
see whether it s marked **poison** or not for she had read several nice
little histories about **children** who had got burnt, and eaten up by
wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not
remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a
red hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut
your finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had
never forgotten that, if you **drink** much from a **bottle** marked
**poison**, it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.

However, this **bottle** was NOT marked **poison**, so **Alice**
ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, it had, in fact, a sort
of mixed flavour of cherry tart, custard, pine apple, roast turkey,
toffee, and hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off.
