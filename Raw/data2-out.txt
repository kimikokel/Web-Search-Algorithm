Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time as she went **down** to look about her and to wonder what
was going to happen next. First, she tried to look **down** and make out
what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and book shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
hung upon pegs. She took **down** a jar from one of the shelves as she
passed; it was labelled ORANGE MARMALADE but to her great disappointment
it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing
somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell
past it.

Well! thought Alice to herself, after such a fall as this, I shall think
nothing of tumbling **down** stairs! How brave they ll all think me at
home! Why, I wouldn t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top
of the house! Which was very likely true.

**Down**, **down**, **down**. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! I
wonder how many miles I ve fallen by this time? she said aloud. I must
be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that
would be four thousand miles **down**, I think for, you see, Alice had
learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and
though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her
knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good
practice to say it over yes, that s about the right distance but then I
wonder what Latitude or Longitude I ve got to? Alice had no idea what
Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand
words to say.

Presently she began again. I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the
earth! How funny it ll seem to come out among the people that walk with
their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think she was rather glad there
WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn t sound at all the right
word but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you
know. Please, Ma am, is this **New** **Zealand** or **Australia**? and
she tried to curtsey as she spoke fancy CURTSEYING as you re falling
through the air! Do you think you could manage it? And what an ignorant
little girl she ll think me for asking! No, it ll never do to ask:
perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.
